# ModelZoo for Pytorch

This is a model zoo project under Pytorch. In this repo I will implement some of basic classification 
models which have good performance on ImageNet. Then I will train them in most fair way as possible and
try my best to get SOTA model on ImageNet. In this repo I'll only consider pure FP16.


## Baseline models

|model | epochs| dtype |batch size*|gpus  | lr  |  tricks|speed|memory cost(MiB)^|top1/top5|
|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:----:|:---:|:------:|:---:|:--------------:|:-------:|
|resnet50|120  |FP16   |128        |  8   |0.4  | -      | 950 |   7700         |77.35/-  |

- I use nesterov SGD and cosine lr decay with 5 warmup epochs by default[2] (to save time), it's more common and effective.
- *Batch size is pre GPU holds. Total batch size should be (batch size * gpus).
- ^This is average memory cost.
- Resnet 50 top5 in log file is not right(actually is top -5), just ignore it.

## Ablation Study on Tricks
Here are lots of tricks to improve accuracy during this years.(If you have another idea please open an issue.)
I want to verify them in a fair way.


Tricks: RandomRotation, Drop out, Label Smoothing[4], Sync BN, SwitchNorm[6], Mixup[5], no bias decay[7], Cutout[5], 
swish activation[10], Stochastic Depth[9], Lookahead Optimizer[11]

Special: Zero-initialize the last BN, just call it 'Zero Î³'.

I'll only use 120 epochs and 128*8 batch size to train them,
I know some tricks may need train more time or larger batch size but it's not fair for others.
You can think of it as a performance in the current situation.

|model | epochs| dtype |batch size*|gpus  | lr  |  tricks|top1/top5  |improve |
|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:----:|:---:|:------:|:---------:|:------:|
|resnet50|120  |FP16   |128        | 8    |0.4  | -      |77.35/-    |baseline|
|resnet50|120  |FP16   |128        | 8    |0.4  |Label smoothing|77.78/93.80 |+0.43 |
|resnet50|120  |FP16   |128        | 8    |0.4  |No bias decay  |77.28/93.61*|-0.07 |
|resnet50|120  |FP16   |128        | 8    |0.4  |Sync BN        |77.31/93.49^|-0.04 |
|resnet50|120  |FP16   |128        | 8    |0.4  |Mixup          |77.41/93.66 |+0.06 |

- *If you only have 1k(128 * 8) batch size, it's not recommend to use this which made unstable convergence and finally 
    can't get a higher accuracy.Origin paper use 64k batch size but impossible for me to follow.
 - ^Though Sync BN didn't improve any accuracy, it's a magic experience which looks like using one GPU to train.

## Usage
### Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04
- CUDA: 10.0, CuDNN: 7.5
- Devices: I use 8 * RTX 2080ti. This project is under pure FP16, it's recommend to use FP16 friendly devices like 
RTX series, V100. If you want to totally reproduce my research, you'd better use same (total) batch size with me. 

### Requirement
- Pytorch: >= 1.1.0
- [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex): nightly version. Support a optimized FP16 tools. 
- [TorchToolbox](https://github.com/deeplearningforfun/torch-toolbox): nightly version. Helper functions to make your code simpler and more readable, it's a optional tools
if you don't want to use it just write them youself.

## ToDo
- [ ] Try Nvidia-DALI
- [ ] Multi-node(distributed) training by Apex or BytePS
- [ ] I may try AutoAugment.This project aims to train models by ourselves to observe and learn,
     it's impossible for me to train this, just copy feels meaningless.
